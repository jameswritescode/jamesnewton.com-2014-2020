              %p Code School is an interactive learning platform based in Orlando, FL that aims to make learning to code easier right in your browser. It was acquired by Pluralsight during my time there.

              %p I worked on challenge implementation for courses like Surviving APIs with Rails, Staying Sharp with Angular.js, and more. I also wrote the Python code executor that powers Try Python and Flying Through Python and contributed on the backend and Angular.js code for JavaScript.com's Try JavaScript.

              %p Chargify is a recurring payment platform with support for many different payment providers and a remote first team.

              %p I was the first Tier 2 support hire and was responsible for helping customers with platform issues, and helping developers. In my spare time I would work on payment gateway integration and wrote the original implementation of the eWay gateway that it used with ActiveMerchant<abbr title='Private. Not the version that made it into the official ActiveMerchant'>*</abbr>.
